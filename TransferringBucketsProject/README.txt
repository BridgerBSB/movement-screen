The idea behind this project was to compare the performance of NCAA players after transferring from one school to another. It took into account their position, transfer year, level of play (P5, D1 mid major, D2, etc.) along with several other variables. It was a multi-month project that required a significant amount of manual data cleaning. There are many files in this folder that were transitional and may be non-essential to the end product.

Unfortunately I did not have time to fully clean and organize all of the files for this project before the end of my internship. If this project is to be revisited, I would focus on the R-Markdown files titled Transfer Bucket Relationships Cleaned.Rmd, Pitching Analysis - Transfer Bucket Relationships.Rmd, and Position Analysis - Transfer Bucket Relationships.Rmd. Obviously, you will also need then the files read in these scripts as well, which are found in the folder. I got further into working with the pitching data than I did the position data.

Additionally, a Tableau dashboard was created about halfway through the project to easily visualize the changes in athlete performance from 2022 to 2023. This was completed before the end of the 2024 NCAA Softball season, so that season of data is not included in the dashboard. It is included everywhere else.

There is no true final deliverable for this. It was an ongoing project that never had a decisive ending as Fourth of July operations were of greater importance. I left off on honing Machine Learning models predicting wRAA and FIP for position and pitchers respectively.

If there were to be next steps on this project I would suggest:
- Spend more time on identifying the most significant predictors of specific targeted variables like wRAA and FIP
- Run more trials/splits, incorporate ensembles, try deep learning techniques like XGBoost, etc. Essentially try to implement a more formal, adequate machine learning model development process.
